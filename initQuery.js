module.exports = `# Welcome to FakerQL!
#
# FakerQL is built on top of faker.js
#
# There are a few default queries and
# mutations you can perform.
#
# Often helpful during development and
# learning GraphQL.
#
# An example query might look like:
#
# {
#   allProducts {
#     id
#     name
#     price
#   }
# }
#
# An example mutation might look like:
#
# {
#   register(email: "hi@jamiebarton.co.uk", password: "F4K3rqL!") {
#     token
#   }
# }
#
`;
